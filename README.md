A hangman game created for fun and for the love of # Python and Pygame

You can freely clone or download this project and do your updates on it
 
 The game selects random words from the list in words.txt and lets you guess the words
  You can customise the words to be used within the file.

  So long as your machine has latest version of python and pygame installed, the game will run by executing 
  the hangman.py file.
  
  
  
  
  Do have a good guessing moment just dont let the man hang though!!!
